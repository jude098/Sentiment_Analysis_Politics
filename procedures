What's sentiment analysis
#Evaluating/Determining if a product/movie review, tweet (a writing) is positive, negative or neutral

#How to collect the data?
#Via Twitter API
#Complicated? Yes, since you need to apply and be approved by Twitter to become a twitter app developer 
#by really stating the use case, which public entity will
#see the information from the Twitter data collected, etc
#I was reading that it takes 2 weeks to get approve, but I was lucky to be within hrs 

#After getting approved, you can create your app, which will collect the public tweets of the people you want to collect,
#in my case the 4 candidates

#importing pertinent libraries

#importing tweety for Pycharm was a pain, since even though I was doing alt + enter over the tweepy and textblolb 
#into PyCharm it would still tell me that it couldn't find the module
#Since Conda is integrated in PyCharm, I added tweepy and textblob packages into Conda's cloud first, then went into PyCharm
# under Preferences, added from Conda environment the packages freshly downloaded and added them into PyCharm
